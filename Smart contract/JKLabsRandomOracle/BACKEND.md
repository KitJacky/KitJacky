# JKLabsRandomOracle (BACKEND)

Version 0.4

I've developed an application using Python Flask that I'm really excited to show you! It has two handy endpoints. One is for generating random numbers with signatures and Mimblewimble proofs, and the other is for verifying those proofs. Let me give you a quick overview of the main features:

### 1. **`generate_mimblewimble_proof(value)`**
   - This function generates a Mimblewimble proof for a given value.
   - It creates a random scalar `r` and calculates the commitment as `(r * value) % (2**256)`.
   - The proof consists of the scalar `r` and the commitment.

### 2. **`verify_mimblewimble_proof(proof, value)`**
   - This function verifies a Mimblewimble proof.
   - It checks if the commitment in the proof matches the calculation `(r * value) % (2**256)`.

### 3. **`/random` endpoint**
   - **GET method**: This generates a random 64-bit number, hashes it using SHA-256, and then signs the hash using a pre-defined Ethereum private key.
   - It also generates a Mimblewimble proof for the random number.
   - The response includes the random number, its signature, the public key, and the Mimblewimble proof.

### 4. **`/verify` endpoint**s
   - **POST method**: This endpoint takes a JSON payload containing a random number and a Mimblewimble proof.
   - It verifies the proof using the `verify_mimblewimble_proof` function.
   - The response indicates whether the proof is valid.

### Support my work and my labs

This project was created in my spare time to share something interesting and useful with the community. Although GitHub hosts this project for free, the backend is using its own server and rented data centre, so maintaining and improving this project and my own lab requires a lot of time, effort and money. If you enjoy using this project and would like to support its continued development, please consider buying me a cup of coffee! I must have two cups a day, so every cup counts!

You can donate via Ethereum to the following address:
